### Table of Contents
This project will cover how to create a scalable model using spark to predict a customer churn. The data used for this project was available by Udacity and itâ€™s about a user log for a fictional streaming music app called Sparkify.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
 
The necessary libraries to run the code in Python version 3.*:
- Anaconda (Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Datetime) and PySpark.
<p>Obs.: It's necessary to unzip the data to run the project.</p>

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In the business world, churn is defined when a customer cancels or abandons the service. Predicting when a customer tends to churn can be very profitable to companies, since this could increase the retention rate, by offering discounts and incentives.

## File Description<a name="files"></a>
- <b>Sparkify.ipynb</b>: a notebook containing all the processes to build a scalable model to predict customer churn for a fictional streaming music app called Sparkify using spark.
- <b>mini_sparkify_event_data.json.zip</b>: a zipped data 
- <b>Sparkify.html</b>: an HTML version of the notebook
